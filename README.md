# Spoke Digits Recognition

Speech recognition - recognizing digits from Google Speech Commands dataset with embodied CNN architectures
Python-Keras scripts for training and testing models. 
These are provided to facilitate replicating the results and experimenting other configurations and parameters.

The script ran in a nvidia-docker environment, Keras 2.2.4 and Tensorflow 1.8.

Folders:

Dataset - includes iCub robot finger representations for digits and scripts to create them from the Google Speech Commands dataset v0.02

Zipfian - scripts for the experiment with the Zipfian distribution (Scenario 1)

Longitudinal - scripts for the longitudinal experiment (Scenario 2)
